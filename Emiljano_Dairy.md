## Day3

--Made some different styles in UI, struggled at the begining with MUI because i haven't worked previously with it./
--Worked on implementing routes, and succesfully did it for a part of project, 
  struggled bcs of some type of routes were deprecated in the latest version/
--We added the logic for loading the questions and had some issues to find the perfect logic for it./
--We improved our queries logic and had some difficulties trying to find the best match for our needed data./

## Day4 

--We started the day trying to get all the datas from database, it was a little bit tricky because we needed to 
get them in a proper way, in order to use them easily in frontend./
--We managed to get the data in a proper way and tried to implement logic into frontend to connect them with MUI components./
--After we analyzed our code we decided to refactor a little bit and restructure our components in order to make our lifes easier,
we created some mockups and tried to put it into action.
