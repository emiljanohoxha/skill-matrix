#Day 3

Focused work mostly on how the user answers are handled.
Previously we decided to automatically create all answers for all the users in the database,
at the moment a survey is created using default data, but this aproach proved dificult
because it required using a complex sql query and a trigger.Insted we decided to go with
a simpler aproach and used a graphql query on the frontend which creates or updates an answer.
Created a TODO list with all of the UI features.
Created some simple UI mockups, because we found out thet we had different views on how the UI should work.
