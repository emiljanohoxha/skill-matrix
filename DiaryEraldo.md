### Day 3

First thing first I made some changes on Page.js styling.
After we set up the Routes I look forward to make logic in start button that will direct user to the Survey Route.
By lot of tries to render questions we found a way. I implemented logic that everytime a user
click next or previous button it will render the right question.
One bug that happened after we implemented the logic of buttons was when we reload the page.
We fixed it by help of our mentors.
